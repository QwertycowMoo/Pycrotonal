### Motivation
As a CS+Music student, I would like to do a project with the recent things I've learned in my electronic music. We've learned a lot about audio synthesis and audio buffers, so I wanted to do a project with synthesizers within Python, since that is the language that I'm most comfortable with. I noticed that our CS+Music curriculum only touches on microtonal music, so I wanted to explore this aspect of music more. My project will create a customizable microtonal synthesizer playable by the keyboard on your machine.

### Tech, Tools, and Style
I will be using Python 3.9+ to code the majority of my project. There is a python library called `PYO` that is able to be my DSP engine to help me create my synthesizer sounds. I'll likely be using the Tkinter package to create the GUI. `Pynput` will be the package I'll use to listen to keyboard input. I'll be coding in the PEP8 style and using `pylint` to lint my code. The builtin `unittest` package will be used to test my code.
